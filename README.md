# Zysk React Design Implementation

This repository contains the completed web page design based on the figma design provided by Zysk Tech in the task using React. The design has been developed and styled with the **Tailwind CSS** framework for responsive and modern UI elements. The website is deployed and hosted on **Vercel**.

## Features

- **React**: The design was implemented using React components, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS was used for styling the design, making it responsive and clean. This utility-first CSS framework helps in quickly styling the layout while keeping the code minimal and readable.
